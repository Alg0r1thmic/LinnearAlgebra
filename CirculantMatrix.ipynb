    "# Circulant Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, I want to introduce you to a new type of matrix: **circulant** matrices.  Like Hermitian matrices, they have orthonormal eigenvectors, but unlike Hermitian matrices we know *exactly* what their eigenvectors are!  Moreover, their eigenvectors are closely related to the famous Fourier transform and Fourier series.  Even more importantly, it turns out that circulant matrices and the eigenvectors lend themselves to **incredibly efficient** algorithms called FFTs, that play a central role in much of computational science and engineering.\n",
